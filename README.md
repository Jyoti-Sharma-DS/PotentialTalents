## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a model for predicting how fit the candidate is for a particular role. Keywords to be used for search are Keywords: “Aspiring human resources” or “seeking human resources”. The dataset provide contains below features 
 
i.  id : unique identifier for candidate (numeric)

ii. job_title : job title for candidate (text)

iii. location : geographical location for candidate (text)

iv. connections: number of connections candidate has, 500+ means over 500 (text)


The data set consists of multiple text and a numeric features. The goal of the project will be to learn from all the features provided and predict  how fit the candidate is for the role? (numeric, probability between 0-1)
